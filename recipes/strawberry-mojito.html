    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This strawberry mojito recipe makes the perfect drink for a hot summer day! I had this drink at a popular chain restaurant and decided to try it at home. I have served it at several different gatherings, and it has always been given rave reviews.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>white sugar, for rimming</li>
        <li>2 large limes, quartered</li>
        <li>1/2 bunch mint leaves</li>
        <li>7 strawberries, quartered</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups club soda</li>
        <li>1 cup white rum</li>
        <li>8 cups ice cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour about 1/2 inch of sugar onto a small, shallow plate. Run a lime wedge around the rims of 8 cocktail glasses, then dip the rims into sugar to coat; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Squeeze all of the lime wedges into a sturdy glass pitcher. Toss juiced limes into the pitcher along with mint, strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Crush with a muddler to release strawberry juice and mint oil. Stir in club soda and rum until sugar has dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour into the prepared glasses over ice cubes to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
